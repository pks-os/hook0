                                    The Data Controller remains solely responsible for the accuracy and adequacy of the
                                    aforementioned instructions. Any changes to the instructions given or the security

                                <p>The Customer undertakes that the Data Subjects have been informed or will be informed
                                    before the transfer of their Personal Data to Hook0 in the scope of the

                                <p>The Product is not intended to process Special Categories of Personal Data.
                                    Therefore, the Customer undertakes to prevent any processing of Special Categories
                                    of Personal Data through the Product and the Services. However, at the Customer
                                    request, processing of Special Categories of Personal Data may be performed by
                                    Hook0. In such case, the Processing shall be covered by a specific addendum to
                                    the DPA to be entered into between the Customer and Hook0. </p>

                                    shall address to the Customer the estimated costs for such assistance. Upon express
                                    acceptation of the estimated cost, Hook0 shall provide assistance pursuant to

                                    critical Hook0 target systems. If the source of the remote connection is
                                    a Hook0 controlled system then device authentication based on a
                                    certificate on the device is implemented. If the source is not under
                                    Hook0 control, it should connect to a virtual desktop system.</p>
                                <p>Any other set up of connections needs to be upfront approved by the
                                    security department.</p>
